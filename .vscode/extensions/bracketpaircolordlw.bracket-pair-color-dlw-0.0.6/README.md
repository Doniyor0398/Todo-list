# Bracket Pair Color DLW

A VS Code extension that gives you a simple command to quickly toggle the global “[Bracket Pair Color DLW](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_60#_high-performance-bracket-pair-colorization)” setting added in VS Code v1.60.

## How to run

- Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Win, Linux) / `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac) and search for the `Toggle 'Bracket Color DLW'` command.

## Important

The extension only toggles the **global** “Bracket Pair Color DLW” setting. If you have set the setting in your workspace, the extension will not work.

## Why creating the extension?

A fun little project. Everyone needs one of those once in a while 🙃
